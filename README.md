# Keras_siamese_contrastive
I have implemented the Model saving and loading part of : https://keras.io/examples/vision/siamese_contrastive/

I have changed the custom embedded layer a little bit, both works same.

Kindly note: I have only made this git for sharing the understanding of loading of siamese model what keras has shown in there example. This git will not talk about accuracy.

For accuracy and stuff one can visit my other git : https://github.com/anukash/Face_recognition_siamese_network.

Thanks 
Happy to help!!!
